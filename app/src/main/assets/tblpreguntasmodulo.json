I sat up and looked round, and there, a sort of monstrous hedgehog, of a dirty white color, with black, loathsome claws that clicked and scraped along the floor, and narrow, yellow eyes of indescribable evil. It slithered along for a yard or two, always looking at me with its cruel, hideous eyes, then, when it reached the second window, which was open, it clambered up the sill and vanished. I got up at once and went to the window; there wasn\u0092t a sign of it anywhere. Of course, I knew it must be something from another world, but it was not till I turned up Popple\u0092s chapter on local traditions that I realized what I had seen.\r\n\r\n She turned eagerly to the large brown volume and read: \u0091Nicholas Herison, an old miser, was hung at Batchford in 1763 for the murder of a farm lad who had accidentally discovered his secret hoard. His ghost is supposed to traverse the countryside, appearing sometimes as a white owl, sometimes as a huge white hedgehog.\u0092\r\n\r\n I expect you read the Popple story overnight, and that made you think you saw a hedgehog when you were only half awake, said Mrs. Norbury, hazarding a conjecture that probably came very near the truth.\r\n\r\n This must be hushed up, said Mrs. Norbury quickly; the servants\u0097\r\n\r\n Hushed up! exclaimed Ada, indignantly; I\u0092m writing a long report on it for the Research Society.\r\n\r\n It was then that Hugo Norbury, who is not naturally a man of brilliant resource, had one of the really useful inspirations of his life.\r\n\r\n It was very wicked of us, Miss Bleek, he said, but it would be a shame to let it go further. That white hedgehog is an old joke of ours; stuffed albino hedgehog, you know, that my father brought home from Jamaica, where they grow to enormous size. We hide it in the room with a string on it, run one end of the string through the window; then we pull it from below and it comes scraping along the floor, just as you\u0092ve described, and finally jerks out of the window.

I sat up and looked round, and there, a sort of monstrous hedgehog, of a dirty white color, with black, loathsome claws that clicked and scraped along the floor, and narrow, yellow eyes of indescribable evil. It slithered along for a yard or two, always looking at me with its cruel, hideous eyes, then, when it reached the second window, which was open, it clambered up the sill and vanished. I got up at once and went to the window; there wasn\u0092t a sign of it anywhere. Of course, I knew it must be something from another world, but it was not till I turned up Popple\u0092s chapter on local traditions that I realized what I had seen.\r\n\r\n She turned eagerly to the large brown volume and read: \u0091Nicholas Herison, an old miser, was hung at Batchford in 1763 for the murder of a farm lad who had accidentally discovered his secret hoard. His ghost is supposed to traverse the countryside, appearing sometimes as a white owl, sometimes as a huge white hedgehog.\u0092\r\n\r\n I expect you read the Popple story overnight, and that made you think you saw a hedgehog when you were only half awake, said Mrs. Norbury, hazarding a conjecture that probably came very near the truth.\r\n\r\n This must be hushed up, said Mrs. Norbury quickly; the servants\u0097\r\n\r\n Hushed up! exclaimed Ada, indignantly; I\u0092m writing a long report on it for the Research Society.\r\n\r\n It was then that Hugo Norbury, who is not naturally a man of brilliant resource, had one of the really useful inspirations of his life.\r\n\r\n It was very wicked of us, Miss Bleek, he said, but it would be a shame to let it go further.

That\u0092s the memo from a first-of-its-kind conference on rare earth elements (REEs) in Europe. Convened in Greece by Milos Conferences, the event brought together economists, geologists, and environmental scientists who are all working to understand the role and future of rare earth elements, which are used in technological applications.\r\n\r\n The event follows hot on the heels of the recent surge in private REE mining firms. Most firms mine in China, which produces 90 percent of the rare earth elements in the world, while Russia hopes to quadruple their output (currently 2 percent of the world\u0092s production) by 2020. Other countries with significant REE production, like the U.S., India, and Australia, will also be increasing efforts to supply the REE market.\r\n\r\n Within a few decades, these countries may be meeting demands from technology companies to build products like rechargeable batteries, magnets, and fluorescent lighting, and consumer technologies like cell phones and DVD players. But like the enterprising pioneers who settled the American West, these REE companies won\u0092t just enrich themselves. They also hope to build an economy of eco-friendly technologies in which REEs play a vital role in powering green innovation.\r\n\r\n In this scenario, an element like dysprosium could become the most desired REE. \u0093An accelerated rate of dysprosium mining is unavoidable,\u0094 writes Komal Habib of the University of Southern Denmark, \u0093in a renewable energy strategy for meeting the climate change challenge.\u0094 Solid dysprosium is essential to the high-powered magnets in wind turbines and is used in electric vehicles, too. These are two of the most promising strategies for reducing carbon emissions, so the fate of our planet may rely on our ability to utilize its resources in the form of REEs.\r\n\r\n Scientists at the convention discussed the feasibility of recycling these resources, which could lessen the need for new mining operations. Others are discussing the locations of new REE deposits, projecting future supply and demand, and discussing potential means of responsibly extracting REEs from the Earth.\r\n\r\n The motivation for rare earth element (REE) mining is shifting from consumer technology to infrastructure. The past year has experienced a flurry of studies assessing REEs\u0092 importance to the renewable energy industry. No doubt this will make a few CEOs even wealthier, but we all stand to benefit: the resulting effect on our planet\u0092s atmosphere could save us all from dangerous temperature extremes.\r\n\r\n But before miners start swinging their pickaxes, we should stop to consider the situation. At first glance, REE mining seems reasonably \u0093green\u0094: it helps us build more responsible technologies, and most REE mining is done in sparsely inhabited areas of central China. But its consequences\u0097both for the miners and the rest of us\u0097merit cautious reflection.\r\n\r\n A piece of this has to do with principles. Some will contend that the Earth is not ours to use and discard, and that saving the Earth\u0092s atmosphere shouldn\u0092t mean scarring its land and rivers. Others will contend that an ecologically irresponsible country like China sending resources to other countries to develop green technology is backwards, and makes the problem worse. History indicates that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such sparsely populated areas are worth preserving. After all, their reaches are vast, and few people who aren\u0092t native to the area will ever experience them.\r\n\r\n There are also the more immediate toxic effects of REE mining. The process uses acid, which is often poured off into hills and water, killing crops and poisoning wells. Questions of mining methodology have hardly been broached\u0097and the relevant regulatory structure is piecemeal, to say the least.\r\n\r\n REE miners, like others in the mining industry, are often hesitan it to confront such questions. One industry representative at the recent conference in Greece requested that strict regulation be avoided. But mining and technology companies have much to gain from a broad agreement on the responsible extraction of REEs. Without consensus, lawsuits will be filed, investors will be doubtful, and consumers will be wary.

Identifying the specific event that caused it all has been tricky.\r\n\r\n That a catastrophic event occurred somewhere on Earth, about 66 million years ago, is written in the geologic record by a layer of sediment known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary. This abrupt change in the rock layer indicates that a cloud of dust covered the Earth, filtering out sunlight and ending the geological era, the Mesozoic, a period that stretched from 252 million to 66 million years ago. Such a dust cloud would block sunlight, killing all plants and animals that needed light to survive and causing a global drop in temperatures.\r\n\r\n In 1980, a team of scientists led by Luis Alvarez formulated a link between this catastrophic event and an asteroid impact by examining the boundary layer in places all over the world, like the Danish island of Zealand, to determine that this layer has much higher levels of iridium than any other layer of the Earth\u0092s crust. This evidence implicated an asteroid, which would be rich in iridium. The team found that to leave this amount of iridium, the asteroid would have to have been about six miles wide. Such a colossal impact would create a global dust cloud, resulting in the K-Pg boundary layer. Subsequent firestorms from raining, molten rock fragments, as well as acid rain, would have continued to take a huge toll on the Earth\u0092s plant and animal species.\r\n\r\n Decades later, researchers and scientists now believe they have found the crater of the asteroid impact: Mexico\u0092s Chicxulub crater. One piece of evidence, they suggest, is its size. As measured by images from STS-99, a NASA radar topography shuttle mission, Chicxulub is 110 miles across - half underwater, half on land - which is the size Alvarez and his team initially predicted the crater would be.\r\n\r\n The crater was initially found in 1978 by a geophysicist named Glen Penfield looking for oil in the Yucatan peninsula. He noticed a vast, semi-circular underwater trough, and then realized it lined up with a similar feature on the land. While he believed it was an impact crater, he was unable to find solid evidence of this, and the presentation of his findings received little attention. It wasn\u0092t until 1990 that the crater was linked to the K-Pg extinction event, when researchers, including Penfield, found tektite glass, which can be the result of only two things - nuclear detonations, and asteroid impacts.\r\n\r\n The theory gained substantial credibility in 2012 when Paul Renne and other researchers applied dating methods to impacts remnants from the crater, as well as to the sedimentary layer at the K-Pg boundary: they were dated to within 32,000 years of each other - both around 66 million years ago - a strong indicator that they occurred at the same time.\r\n\r\n It\u0092s not a big surprise that the impact in Mexico caused so many species to become extinct, Renne says. The Chicxulub impact\u0085 pushed the global ecosystem across a threshold that triggered a planetary state shift.\u0094 In addition to the previously mentioned effects - firestorms and a global dust cloud - the impact would\u0092ve also produced huge tsunamis and earthquakes around the world.\r\n\r\n Another potential candidate - taking into account location and timing - is the Shiva Crater, located off the coast of India.

Certain mental skills are boosted by our liberal use of smartphones and computers. These unexpected benefits can be as marginal as the ability to dream in color, or as central to our biology as improvements to basic cognitive functions. For instance, studies of people who use technology frequently, especially people who play video games, show that such activities can increase visuospatial awareness, and can improve one\u00b4s ability to see in dim environments.\r\n\r\n It\u00b4s also likely that the Internet has strengthened certain research skills, making us more resourceful, and quicker at processing and sorting through information. A researcher from Tufts University finds that we have developed a new form of reading: a non-linear speed reading, which scans material for interesting keywords and orchestrates eye movements in order to gather the most information as quickly as possible. As we practice sorting through the bulk of information we are faced with every day, our brains get better at doing it.\r\n\r\n However, it would be hasty to look at these limited ways that the web improves our brain and assume that the Internet is making us smarter. In a Guardian article published in 2015, journalist Daniel Levitin provides a review of the effects of technology on our brains, which makes for harrowing reading. Levitin argues that multitasking is taking its toll. Our addiction to multitasking and constant task-switching, he writes, has led to increased production of cortisol and adrenaline hormones, which can overstimulate your brain and cause mental fog or scrambled thinking.\u0094 The strides we make in increasing our ability to skim information quickly result in a weakening of the deep, comprehensive cognitive functions that allow us to read carefully, to learn fully, and to think deeply.\r\n\r\n We know that our brains are hugely plastic: the pathways that we use most often change as our environment and habits change. Neuroplasticity is the idea that our brains adapt to new technologies and activities, meaning every generation, and in fact every person has a different brain from any other. For our generation, faced with exciting progress in technology, the way we consume information on the Internet affects the way we consume information in other ways, too. We have, over the course of a couple decades, expanded our capacity to skim and sort through information as it balloons around us; yet we are neglecting our ability, developed for centuries, to read and think deeply.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Doomsday prophets of digital media sometimes use research to push their claim, citing studies that point out how cultural phenomena can change the brain.\u0094 But real neuroscientists wash their hands of such connections. Of course, every time we learn something new, our brain adjusts to the changes; it\u00b4s not like our neural pathways are located in the liver. But the reality of our brains\u00b4 plasticity doesn\u00b4t mean that it\u00b4s a ball of wax, melted down by our experiences and formed in the mold of technology.\r\n\r\n Our experiences do not revolutionize the basic ways in which our brain processes information. The myth of speed-reading has shown just that, as denounced by Walter Pitkin: You will get little or nothing from the printed page if you bring it nothing but your eye.\u0094 The ability to multitask efficiently, also, has been outed as a fabrication, not only by scientific research, but also by motorists everywhere, as we give a wide berth to a swerving vehicle only to spot its driver with a phone in one hand and a burger in the other.\r\n\r\n Furthermore, the derivative benefits of experience are mostly specific to the experiences themselves. If you train somebody to do something (shoot video game characters, shoot pool, memorize multiplication tables), they improve at that one thing, but not much else. Sudoku doesn\u00b4t improve your math, translating Greek doesn\u00b4t make you a better writer, and doing crosswords doesn\u00b4t make you smarter. Successful people don\u00b4t gorge their brains on intellectual superfoods; they immerse themselves in their discipline. Lawyers read lots of cases, tech bloggers read lots of tech blogs.\r\n\r\n The effects of encountering digital media are probably a lot less apocalyptic than the panic insinuates. Critics of digital media speak as if the our minds are entirely subject to what we put in them, the neurological form of you are what you eat.\u0094 Just like little kids who think wearing light up shoes make them faster, they\u00b4re convinced that writing 160-character blurbs makes you think in 140-character blurbs, or that seeing 3 second GIFs make you experience life in 3 second GIFs.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the first passage suggests which of the following about the use of digital media?
